It is the code that will be inside the code template file. This means, this code will be the template used by MCreator when generating the element.

Code template files use FreeMarker. You can find the official documentation on [this](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/index.html) page.
However, MCreator adds multiple expressions and utility functions or macros, which can be found in files inside the `utils` folder of a generator.
Those files can be used by importing them adding `<#include "fullFileName">` at the beginning of the code.
